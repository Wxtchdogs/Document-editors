<p>This is a very simple text file editor that allows you to create files, add words and delete words.

<p>----------------HOW TO USE----------------
<p>1. Create a folder with the name "word-lists" in the same directory that you have the text editor script stored in. 

<p>2. Run the script. You will be asked to enter the name of your text file. Enter the name of the text file to open within that directory. 
<p>If a file with that name does not exit then you will be asked if you would like to create a new txt file with that name. If so type "y".

<p>3. You will now be presented with a list of options to configure the file's contents. The list will look as follows:

<p>+----------------------------------------------------------+
<p>| Please chose an option                                   |
<p>|                                                          |
<p>| 1) Add words to file                                     |
<p>| 2) Remove words from file                                |
